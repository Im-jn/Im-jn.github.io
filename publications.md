## Work Project

- Developed an integrated display platform for our research group called the TianSuan Constellation with Vue Freamework. This platform showcases the real-time orbital positions of TianSuan Constellation satellites, as well as the various application deployment modules. I personally built and maintained the entire system and have participated in several external presentations on behalf of the school and our research group. Can be accessed via link [Tiansuan Platform](http://tle.tiansuan.site/#/)

- Participated in the **VMware development team** for the virtual machine front-end program and assisted in resolving a critical issue in the client application. Acquired proficiency in the companyâ€™s front-end development framework(Angular) and implemented the use of the Opus audio decoder to standardize front-end audio decoding strategies. Eventually developed a solution to resolve audio stuttering issues of the virtual machine front-end program on macOS, greatly enhancing the user audio playback experience.
