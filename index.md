## Research Interests

- Deep Learning
- Large Language Models
- Data Mining
- Spatial-temporal data
- [My latest research proposal (demo)](https://im-jn.github.io/file/RP.pdf)üîó

In the past year, I was engaged in AI spatial-temporal big data research, under the supervision of a PostDoc research fellow Dr. Haitao Yuan from Prof. Cong Gao‚Äôs group in NTU.
I am still actively exploring new research directions, currently working on a research that incorporates reinforcement learning to construct LLMs‚Äô prompt agent. Although my previous work primarily focused on AI within the realm of Data Mining I am eager to explore other areas of AI during my Ph.D. studies.
